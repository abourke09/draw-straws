Draw Straws React Redux Project
======================================

Application Description
---------------
Welcome to the Draw Straws React Redux Project. This web app employs Javascript, React, Redux, and a Rails API to let users play a game of Draw Straws and persist that game data for later viewing. The idea behind a game of Draw Straws is that it allows a group of people to choose from a number of options. For example, if a household has a set of chores that need to be done each week, the family can Draw Straws to see who gets to pick a chore first. That way, each week a random person will get the privilege of choosing the perceived easiest chore. The web app also displays all of the Players and Game details for later viewing.
