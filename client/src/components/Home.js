    <p>How to play: Draw Straws is a selection game that helps groups assign specific tasks to individuals.
    To play, give the game a title and enter each player's name, then list each possible option for the game.
    For example, a group of roommates could name their game House Chores and list options such as 1)Take out the trash,
    2)Do the dishes, and 3)Vacuum the living room. Once that information is entered, hit the 'Draw Straws' button.
    The game will then select a player at random, who will get the first choice to select an option.
    The next randomly selected player will get to choose from the remaining options. This process repeats until
    all of the players have chosen. The game is saved and can be reviewed in the All Games section.</p>
